"""Turn the animations of the documentation into MP4 and GIF files for creators.

Reddit, Discord, forums and video editors do not all show animated WebP. This
script reads the animations from `docs/images/<language>/`, splits them into
frames with Pillow and writes `docs/media/<name>-<language>.mp4` and `.gif` with
ffmpeg. Run it after `tests/e2e/screenshots.sh`, which renders the animations;
it needs Pillow and ffmpeg.

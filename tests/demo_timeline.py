"""The recording that the live demo of the website plays (docs/demo/).

The demo shows the cards without Home Assistant: it replays what the integration
did in a few games at a simulated board, as Home Assistant would have sent it to
the cards. The integration plays them here for real, in the Home Assistant of the
tests, on a clock that moves only when the games do, so that every recording is
the same until the integration or the games change.

After each move at the board, the timeline keeps the states of the Autodarts
entities that changed, with the moment of the move, and the answers of the
autodarts/positions command that the training card asks for. `python
scripts/record_demo.py` writes it to docs/demo/timeline.json; the screenshot bot
does so with the images, so that the demo follows the integration.
